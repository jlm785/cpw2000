This directory contains detailed information of the interfaces of all files.

Make sure that OUTPUT_DIRECTORY and INPUT are correct in Doxyfile.

If documentation.html is not present, check that your computer has doxygen and graphviz installed 
and run doxygen in the doxy directory.  Then just link html/index.html to here

If the documentation is already present just refresh "ln -s html/index.html documentation.html"
