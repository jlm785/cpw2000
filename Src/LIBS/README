Subroutines taken from existing libraries.  See each case for copyright

blas and lapack contain the linear algebra subroutines required by the code.
They are here so that you can always run the code in the absence of other versions.
You are strongly advised to link with the other versions as they are much faster in general.

lbfgs and esdf_read can be obtained from their source, but as they are not critical, it is better
to use the present implementations because they have been MODIFIED.  Otherwise you will have to
adapt the original subroutines.

The original subroutines are at
