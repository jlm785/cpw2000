This directory contains subroutines for fast fourier transforms
that have the same call as the old cray subroutines.

The FFTs were written by Norman Troullier and are impressively fast.

In principle this directory should be empty unless you work with jlm.

IF THIS DIRECTORY IS NOT EMPTY AND YOU WANT TO USE
THE SUBROUTINES PLEASE GET THE NECESSARY AUTHORIZATION
AS YOU ARE ACCESSING NON-PUBLIC SOURCE CODE
