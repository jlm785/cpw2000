This directory contains blas translation subroutines that handles 
those nasty single/double precisions problems...

As I do not have an account in an old Cray I haven't tested them!!!!!!!

BE VERY CAREFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you test and they work let me know so I can remove this warning :-)
