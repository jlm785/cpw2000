This directory contains fortran source for the BLAS subroutines
used in the program.

They are taken from   www.netlib.org

They have double precision by default. For single precision see below.

If your machine as a compiled blas library you should use it. That is
do not compile these subroutines in the libpw.a library.

f77 .....  -lblas       should do the trick

If you replace at least dgemm.f dgemv.f and ddot.f (the others are not
important for running times) by vendor-optimized compiled versions of 
the subroutines, you should see an significant (eg 10%) increase in
execution speed. If you have good FFTs the speedup could be larger... 

Single precision....

If in your machine single precision is real*8 you may have to use
the single precision blas subroutines of the vendor to obtain
a nice speedup. Here is how you can get it:

Copy the subroutines in directory _single to this directory, replacing
dgemm.f dgemv.f and ddot.f. Those subroutines call semm.f sgemv.f and
sdot.f.

Compile into the library libpw.a all those subroutines.
Link with the blas library. You should see a speedup of the program.
