This directory contains timing subroutines.

They suffer from the infamous Y2K bug.

I will correct them next millenium :-))))) 

In the meantime I am worrying about the Y10K bug...

The subroutines here work with gfortran and ifort
and should work with a compliant Fortran 95 compiler
as far as I know.

If they do not work, just compile and link with the subroutines
in the _dummy directory, or search in the fossil area
something that may work.
