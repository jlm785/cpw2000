for_str:   implement f channel in for_str_nl_kb

kdotp:     implement real kdotp for a subset of the bands

sym:       The "normal" algorithm to find the space group assumes
           that the lattice supplied is minimal. In the case of a superlattice
           this is not true. The current subroutines have a quick fix that
           produces space-group that is a sub-group of the true space-group
           of the crystal. That choice is arbitrary, so some thought on
           the problem may be needed.

vff:       This is a quick fix.  Needs some further thought.

xc:        Revisit link to libxc.  Implement the spin versions.
