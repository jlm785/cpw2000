Here are the subroutines whose prefix indicate what type of calculations they do


dos:       density of states (dos) and integrals of a function f with dos (dosf).

move:      molecular dynamics and structure optimization.

for_str:   calculate forces and stresses.  It only works with s, p, and d pseudopotentials.

kdotp:     kdotp post-post_process

metric:    This group of files should identify the lattice from the dot product of the lattice vectors.
           It is based on a senior project by Alvaro Ladeira.

opt:       Optical calculations

out:       Output for bands, density of sates (dos) and optical (opt)

plot:      Plots of the density (rho), potential (v) and wavefunction (psi) in 1D, 2D or 3D.

pw_rho_v:  read and write the "PW_RHO_V.DAT" file which is the output from cpw and input for cpw_post_process.

size:      calculate array sizes

sym:       identify the space group operations

vff:       add the energy of a keating model to the first principles total energy.

xc:        exchange and correlation
