Several small utility programs:

convert_2Dplot.f90

   converts the 2D gnuplot file into a more general file with just the data for plotting with other software

cpw_kdotp.f90

   If a k.p model has been generated by a previous run of cpw_post_process, it explores that model (band structure).

   Must be compiled with libpw.

cpwin_geom.f90

   Reads the crystal structure from the cpw.in file and prints relevanr crystllographic information.
   It generates a .cif file that can be used in many other codes.

   Must be compiled with libpw.

gen_PW.f90

   generates the input file cpw.in by answering a few questions about the crystal cell.  It can be adapted later in any text editor.

pre_relax.f90

   For tetrahedral bonded crystals it applies a valence force field model to guess the relaxed geometries.   It reads a cpw.in file and writes the corresponding relaxed file.

   It must be compiled against the main libpw library and have the esdf modules.  For example:
   cp ../src/esdf.mod esdf.mod
   cp ../src/esdf_key.mod esdf_key.mod
   ifort -mkl pre_relax_vff.f90 ../libpw.a

pw_rho_v_2.old.f90

   Changes the format of PW_RHO_V.DAT to an older format.

   It must be compiled against the main libpw library

pw_rho_v_2_xsf.f90

   Writes a file in the xsf format for plotting the crystal structure in vesta or xcrysden

pwdat2cpwin.f90

   Converts the old fixed format PW.DAT file into the new cpw.in input file in a format for being parsed.  Examples are in the Structures/OLD_format.

   It must be compiled against the main libpw library

zz_potkb.f90

   Writes a pseudopotential file for cpw in the _POTKB_F format with the Coulomb potential for H and He, or a zero potential
   (for an empty lattice calculation) or some other local potential coded by the user.
