This directory contains the files needed to use quantum esspresso (QE) 
or abinit after a cpw2000 run.

The input is the PW_RHO_V.DAT file used for post-processing

Files in_rho_v.f90 and in_rho_v_pseudo.f90 were modified and not yet merged in the main
library.  Remove them after updating the library.

To compile the program run the command

$F90 pwrhov2other.f90  write_pwscf_in.f90  write_pwscf_upf_in.f90 in_rho_v.f90  in_rho_v_pseudo.f90 \
     default_conf.f90 $LIBPW.A -o pwrhov2other.exe

Run that program in a directory where you have the relevant PW_RHO_V.DAT file.

    For Quantum Espresso
    --------------------

For each atom with chemical symbol XX in the crystal calculated by  cpw2000
this program will  generates a file XX_nc_upf.in for input to the QE pseudopotential generator.  
This should be equivalent to the original atom input file (atom.dat).
Obviously check the file as this is alpha code.
Running the command

$QEDIRECTORY/bin/ld1.x < XX_nc_upf.in

will generate a lot of files including XX_LDA_ncpp.UPF that has the pseudopotential in 
Unified Pseudopotential Format for atom species XX.

It will generate also the file pwscf.in that has the atomic configuration etc... for the
QE plane-wave code.
Running the command

$QEDIRECTORY/bin/pw.x < pwscf.in

will do the crystal calculation.

      For abinit
      ----------      
      
It will generate the input file abinit.in with the crystal specification

      For both cases
      --------------

The atomic program later than 4.805 will also generate the relevant pseudopotentials.
Both codes have an extensive library of pseudopotentials.


THIS IS ALPHA CODE, CHECK THE FILES!!!!
