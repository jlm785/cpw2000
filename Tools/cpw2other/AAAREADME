This directory contains the files needed to use quantum esspresso (QE)
or abinit after a cpw2000 run.

The input is the PW_RHO_V.DAT file used for post-processing


To compile the program run the command

$F90 pwrhov2other.f90  write_pwscf_in.f90  write_pwscf_upf_in.f90 default_conf.f90 write_abinit_in.f90 \
     default_conf.f90 $LIBPW.A -o pwrhov2other.exe

Where $F90 is ifx, ifort, gfortran,... and $LIBPW.A is the library of the main code
libpw_ifort.a or ... file.

Run that program in a directory where you have the relevant PW_RHO_V.DAT file.

    For Quantum Espresso
    --------------------

It will generate a file pwscf.in that has the atomic configuration etc... for the
QE plane-wave code.

For each atom with chemical symbol XX in the crystal calculated by cpw2000
this program will  generates a file XX_nc_upf.in for input to the QE pseudopotential generator.
This should be equivalent to the original atom input file (atom.dat).

Running the command

$QEDIRECTORY/bin/ld1.x < XX_nc_upf.in

will generate a lot of files including XX_LDA_ncpp.UPF that has the pseudopotential in
Unified Pseudopotential Format for atom species XX.

Running the command

$QEDIRECTORY/bin/pw.x < pwscf.in

will do the crystal calculation.

Obviously check you reproduce the cpw2000 results.  Things like total energies should agree
within several decimal places.

Notice that the atomic program (github.com/jlm785/pseudopotentials) can generate the UPF files
corresponding to the XX_POTKB_F.DAT.  Again expect agreement within several decimal places.

QE does not use Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials with spin-orbit.  This limits the comparison
of the two codes.



      For abinit
      ----------

It will generate the input file abinit.in with the crystal specification.

This has not been used in a long time, so take extra care...
