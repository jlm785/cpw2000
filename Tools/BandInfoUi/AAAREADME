Instructions

1. You should have python3 and PyQt5 installed

   sudo pip install PyQt5

   or whatever it takes in your distribution

2. You should have xmgrace installed.  (https://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/)
   You need to identify the path to grace_np.h, which can be /usr/include or /opt/local/include
   and the path to libgrace_np.a, which can be /usr/lib or /usr/lib64 or /opt/local/lib.
   Use the find command to find them.

   If in step 4 you get an error related to "-fPIC" (position independent code) you
   will have to compile libgrace_np.a from source.  In the Makefile of the grace_np directory add
   that option to CFLAGS:

   CFLAGS=$(CFLAGS0) -I$(TOP) -I. $(CPPFLAGS) -fPIC

   then in the grace top level run .configure (you may have to install motif and other stuff)
   and in the grace_np directory just run make with the altered Makefile.  You do not need (and maybe
   shouldn't) install it if you already have grace from your distribution.

3. Compile the command line version

   ifort BandInfo.f90 out_band_fold_xmgrace.f90 -o BandInfo.exe

   You can find out_band_fold_xmgrace.f90 in ../../_source/out_band_dos_opt.  Just link here.

4. Compile the dynamic library (adapt paths for your system)

   gcc -I /usr/include/ -shared gracedyn.c -o gracedyn.so -L /usr/lib -lgrace_np

   If you get an error related to "-fPIC" (position independent code) go back to point 2. and run

   gcc -I /usr/include/ -shared gracedyn.c -o gracedyn.so path_to_grace/grace_np/libgrace_np.a

   where path_to_grace is where you have installed

5.  Run the user interface

    python3 BandInfo.py

6. Inside the Ui navigate to the directory where you have BAND.DAT and BAND_SO.DAT files
