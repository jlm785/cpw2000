This is a graphical tool analyzer for band structures.
It was written by Carlos Loia Reis around 2022.

It is based on python and Qt (https://www.qt.io), so you should have them installed on your computer.
If you do not have it installed ask your local guru.

It has been tested on Kubuntu and almalinux.
These are quite different linux distributions (debian and redhad based)
so it will probably work on your distribution as python and Qt claim to be cross-platform.

Installation:

  It is recommended (but not required) to first crete a virtual environment for python

  my-dir$ virtualenv QtBandViwer

  creating a directory named QtBandViwe.

  If it doesn't work install virtualenv

  my-dir$ pip3 install virtualenv

  and repeat the command to create the virtual environment.

  Then the  BandDat.py orbinfo.ui QtBandViewer.py QtBandViewer.ui files to the newly created
  QtBandViewer directory.

  Inside that virtual environment (cd QtBandViewer) install the packages you need

  QtBandViewer$ pip3 install matplotlib

  Now you can run the python code

  QtBandViewer$ python3 QtBandViewer.py

  If it works you will see a new window with several buttons and pannels.

Analyzing a band structure:

  In your window press the "load"button and navigate to a "BAND.DAT.bv" or "BAND_SO.DAT.bv"
  previously generated by the MTB option of cpw_post_process (currently option 2).
  If everything works you will see a pannel with a band structure.  Each dot represents a calculated
  enegy band for a given k-point.

  Clicking on the buttons you can filter the contributions by atom, species and angular momentum,
  and the dot size will vary according to the selected contribution to the corresponding wave-function.

  Notice that it works with both normal and unfolded band structures.
