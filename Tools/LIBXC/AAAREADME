This subroutines allow the use of libxc (https://tddft.org/programs/libxc/)
instead of the subroutines included with the cpw2000 code.
Just compile this subroutines with the main program BEFORE linking to the libpw library.

Here are examples that you can change according to your directory structure

 ifort -qmkl ../../Src/cpw_variables.f90 ../../Src/cpw.f90 libxcf03.f90 LIBXC/*.f90 ../../Src/libpw_ifort.a -L/home/jlm/_pw/libxc/lib -lxcf03 -lxc

 gfortran ../../Src/cpw_variables.f90 ../../Src/cpw.f90 libxcf03.f90 LIBXC/*.f90 ../../Src/libpw_gfortran.a -L/home/jlm/_pw/libxc/lib -lopenblas -lpthread -lgomp -lxcf03 -lxc

you need the modules from libxcf03.f90.

You have to implement yourself other functionals if you want.
Check the elk code (https://elk.sourceforge.io/) for inspiration, as it looks neat
and similar to the present case.
