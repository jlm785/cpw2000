This is a program that fits the Murnaghnan,
F. D. Murnaghan, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 30, 244 (1944),
or Birch-Murnaghan, F. Birch J. Geophys. Res. 83, 1257 (1978),
equations of state to a series E_j(V_i) of calculated
total energies for structures j and volumes i.

It identifies which structure is stable at a given pressure and generates
interpolated plots of E_j(V) and V(p), and gives the value of the
transition pressure.  For each structure it also gives the equilibrium
volume V_0, energy at that volume E_0, bulk modulus at equilibrium B(V_0)
and its derivative dB/dp at V_0.

The input file must have the following structure:

1st line:  Indication of the type of fit "MURNA" or "BIRCH" in all uppercase or
           all lowercase.

2nd line:  Number of structures "nstr" (positive integer currently limited to 10)

Then we will have a BLOCK for each structure

last line: Maximum pressure "pmax" and number of points "npts" for plot
           (positive real and positive integer)

Each BLOCK has the following structure

1st block line:   Number of calculated volumes "npt" (positive integer currently
                  limited to 40)

2nd block line:   Volume factor "volfac" and label (real number and string with at most
                  10 characters; the whole line must have less than 100 characters)
                  The label is optional.

3rd to npt+2:     lattice constant "alatt" or volume in atomic units (Bohr or Bohr**3) and
                  energy in atomic units (Hartree).  If "volfac" is negative
                  it is assumed that the volume is read.  Otherwise the volume
                  is V = volfac*alatt**3. (positive real and real number).

Running:

The program is self contained so just compile

$ gfortran -o eqst.exe eqst.f90

   OR

$ ifort -o eqst.exe eqst.f90

   OR...

and run

$ eqst.exe < input_file

Besides the default output it will also generate 4 files for plotting with the .gp
file extension

To see the plots install gnuplot and run

$ gnuplot eqst_com.gp
$ gnuplot qofv_com.gp

You can edit by hand those *_com.gp files to obtain a pdf file.

The original code is from David Wood in the early 80s.  It has been modified
a few times.  The most recent modification converted to fortran 90
(f77 was reaching 50 years) added some documentation and replaced the
output plotting files.  Even google could not help me finding
a reference to the original plotting software let alone a working
version.

There is still room for improvement, in particular documentation and
new plot software options, but my time is limited...
